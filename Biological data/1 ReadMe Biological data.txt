ReadMe Biological dataThe following ReadMe gives a brief overview of the columns in “Census data Benin.csv”, “Census data China.csv”, and “Temperature response data.csv”.“Census data Benin.csv”: Census data for the tropical species, Clavigralla shadabi, from Benin* Time: day of year in which a census was taken* A: adult density (number of adults per 50 host plants)* A_SE: standard error of adult density* A_SE_L: lower estimate of adult density (Adults – A_SE)* A_SE_H: higher estimate of adult density (Adults + A_SE)“Census data China.csv”: Census data for the temperate species, Apolygus lucorum, from Dafeng, China* Time: day of year in which a census was taken* A: adult density (number of adults per 50 host plants)* A_SE: standard error of adult density* A_SE_L: lower estimate of adult density (Adults – A_SE)* A_SE_H: higher estimate of adult density (Adults + A_SE)“Temperature response data.csv”: Laboratory data on fitness metrics and fitness components for the 21 insect populations analyzed in the manuscript.* Reference: Literature reference from which the temperature response data was obtained* Population: Species name and geographical location (to distinguish between populations with the same species name)* Location: Geographical location, typically the country name followed by a name of the regionin which the insect was collected* Lat: latitude of the population, reported in the manuscript or based on description in manuscript* Lon: longitude of the population, reported in the manuscript or based on description in manuscript* Habitat: Climate types based on the Köppen Climate Classification (Table S1 in the manuscript)* Subfamily: subfamily of population (either Heteroptera or Sternorrhyncha)* T_C: Temperature of climate chamber in ?* T_K: Temperature of climate chamber in K* Birth_Rate: Estimate of the per capita birth rate at temperature T_K* Birth_Source: Where the per capita birth rate estimates were obtained or calculated* Dev_Rate: Estimate of the juvenile development rate at temperature T_K* Dev_Source: Where the development rate estimates were obtained or calculated* Juv_Mortality: Estimate of the juvenile per capita mortality rate at temperature T_K* Jmort_Source: Where the juvenile per capita mortality rate estimates were obtained or calculated* Survival: Estimate of the survival at temperature T_K* Surv_Source: Where the survival estimates were obtained or calculated* Adult_Mortality: Estimate of the adult per capita mortality rate at temperature T_K* Amort_Source: Where the adult per capita mortality rate estimates were obtained or calculated* Adult_Longevity: Estimate of the adult longevity at temperature T_K* Long_Source: Where the adult longevity estimates were obtained or calculated* R0: Estimate of the net reproductive rate at temperature T_K* R0_Source: Where the net reproductive rate estimate was obtained or calculated* r_m: Estimate of the intrinsic population growth rate at temperature T_K* r_m_Source: Where the intrinsic population growth rate estimates were obtained or calculated
