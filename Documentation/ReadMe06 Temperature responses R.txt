ReadMe for “Temperature response parameters.R”The following ReadMe gives a brief overview of how to use “Temperature response parameters.R”. Please note that running this script is not strictly necessary for the populations in the manuscript as all temperature response parameters already exist in “Temperature response parameters.csv” in the “Model Parameters” folder. Also, please note that the nonlinear least squares regression function nls in R must be given a ‘start’ list of rough parameter estimates. To do this efficiently, this script uses the parameter estimates in “Temperature response parameters.csv” in the ‘start’ list of nls, which is a circular method for parameter estimation. All parameters, however, were initially estimated by providing rough estimates in the ‘start’ list of nls, and can thus be estimated a priori by ‘seeding’ each parameter column in “Temperature response parameters.csv” with a rough estimate of each parameter.Input: User-defined species name and location for an insect population or all = TRUEOutput: Updated “Temperature response parameters.csv” file (if save = TRUE) and print out of the temperature response parameters for either a specified population (if all = FALSE) or all populations (if all = FALSE)To run: 1. Update variable species (line 13) and location (line 14) with a species name and location from “Temperature response parameters.csv”. If a new population is added to “Temperature response parameters.csv”, then parameters must be ‘seeded’ by adding a rough estimate to each parameter column (this is used in the ‘start’ list of nls to estimate parameters via nonlinear regression). Set all = TRUE (line 15) if the script is to be run for all populations in “Temperature response parameters.csv” or set all = FALSE if the script is to be run just for the specified population. 2. To save parameter fits (over existing values in “Temperature response parameters.csv”), change save from FALSE to TRUE in line 183. Run the scriptPotential issues:* The script only works if the working directory (see line 10) is in the main folder of the downloaded GitHub repo* The variable species (line 13) and location (line 14) must exist within “Temperature response parameters.csv” and match the “Population” and “Location” columns exactly* Some modifications to the “start” list of the various nls functions throughout the script may be needed for new populations not in “Temperature response parameters.csv”* If script yields Error: “singular gradient matrix at initial parameter estimates”, it may be that a parameter value is 0 in “Temperature response parameters.csv”. In this case, ‘seed’ the parameter with a small non-zero number and try to run the script again.Script details:Lines 5-10	Load required packages and set working directoryLines 12-18	Have user enter required informationLines 20-41	Read in, and then find selected population in, “Temperature response parameters.csv”Lines 43-45	Obtain data for selected population (note: Apolygus lucorum is automatically set from its field census location to the location reported in “Temperature response data.csv”)Lines 47-62	Remove columns that do not contain temperature data and set minimum and maximum values for x-axes of plots as well as the reference temperature used in the nls functionsLines 65-95	Fit parameters for intrinsic growth rate, rm, via nls (note: for Clavigralla tomentosicollis in Burkina Faso, rMax (“rMax”) and Topt,r (“Toptr”) are first set to data and then nls is used to estimate Tmax,r (“Tmaxr”) and ?r (“sr”))Lines 98-111	Fit parameters of the net reproductive rate, R0, via nlsLines 114-127	Fit parameters of the per capita birth rate, b, via nlsLines 130-155	Fit parameters of the juvenile per capita mortality rate, ?J, via nls (note: for Myzus persicae in Canada Chatham and Aulacorthum solani in US Ithaca, ?_(J,T_R ) (“dJTR”) is first set to data and then nls is used to estimate AJ (“AdJ”))Lines 158-180	Fit parameters for the adult per capita mortality rate, ?A, via nls (note: for Aulacorthum solani in Brazil, ?_(A,T_R ) (“dATR”) is set to data and nls is used to estimate AA (“AdA”))Lines 183-203	For the development rate, g, quantify Topt,g (“Toptg”) and Tmax,g (“Tmaxg”) directly from the data (note: for the Brazil populations and Apolygus lucorum, the index i specifying the temperature treatment of the temperature optima is also updated)Lines 205-246	Fit parameters of the development rate, g, by first fitting gTR (“gTR”) and Ag (“Ag”) to data below the temperature optima (≤ Topt,g) and then AL (“AL”), TL (“TL”) and gmax (“gMax”) to data at all laboratory temperatures (Note: for Myzus persicae in Canada Chatham, it is possible to fit all remaining parameters via one nls; see lines 206-217)Lines 247-266	If nls fails (error = TRUE), then fit TL (“TL”) and AL (“AL”) separately to data below the temperature optima (≤ Topt,g) and then fit gmax (“gMax”) to data at all temperaturesLines 268-289	Plot development rate thermal response and fit minimum developmental temperature (Tmin) via nls (note: for Apolygus lucorum and Acyrthosiphon pisum, Tmin is set based on the literature or field observations, respectively)Lines 291-302	Break the for loop if the analyses are run for a specified species (all = FALSE) and then save (if save = TRUE) and print the model parameters (if the population was found in “Temperature response parameters.csv”; i.e., if found = TRUE)
