ReadMe for “Statistical analyses.R”This ReadMe gives a brief overview of how to use “Statistical analyses.R”. Please note that this script is sufficient alone to report the main results (including Figs. 3-5) discussed in the manuscript.Input: Model predictions from “Model predictions” folderOutput: Statistical analyses and plots presented in Figures 3-5 of the manuscriptTo run: 1. Simply run the scriptPotential issues:* The script only works if the working directory (line 11) is in the main folder of the downloaded GitHub repoScript details:Lines 5-20	Load required packages, set working directory, and read in model predictionsLines 23-74	Perform statistical analyses: nonlinear regressions of model predictions versus latitude (Figs. 3,5) and of model predictions versus directly integrating TPCs (Fig. 4)Lines 78-273	Construct plots for Figures 3-5 of the manuscriptLines 79-107	Construct plots for intrinsic growth rate, rm (Figs. 3A, 4A)Lines 110-138	Construct plots for net reproductive rate, R0 (Figs. 3B, 4B)Lines 141-169	Construct plots for survival to reproduction (Figs. 3c, 4C)Lines 172-184	Construct plot for per capita birth rate (Fig. 3D)Lines 187-215	Construct plots for development time (Fig. 3E, 4D)Lines 218-230	Construct plot for adult longevity (Fig. 3F)Lines 233-244	Construct plot for mean adult density (Fig. 5A)Lines 247-259	Construct plot for population variation (Fig. 5B)Lines 262-273	Construct plot for active season (Fig. 5C)
