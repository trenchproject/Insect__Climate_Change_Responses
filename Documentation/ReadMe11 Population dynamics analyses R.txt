ReadMe for “Population dynamics analyses.R”This ReadMe gives a brief overview of how to use “Population dynamics analyses.R”. Please note that running this script is not strictly necessary for the populations in the manuscript as all model predictions already exist in “Predictions population dynamics.csv” the “Model predictions” folder.Input: User-defined species name and location for an insect population or all = TRUEOutput: Updated “Predictions population dynamics.csv” in the “Model predictions” folder (if save = TRUE) for either a specified population (if all = FALSE) or all populations (if all = FALSE)To run: 1. Update variable species (line 13) and location (line 14) with a species name and location from “Temperature response parameters.csv” or set all = TRUE to run the analyses for all populations2. To save model predictions (over existing files in “Model predictions” folder), change save from FALSE to TRUE in line 183. Run the scriptPotential issues:* The script only works if the working directory (see line 9) is in the main folder of the downloaded GitHub repo* The variable species (line 13) and location (line 14) must exist within “Temperature response parameters.csv” and match the “Population” and “Location” columns exactlyScript details:Lines 5-18	Load required packages, set working directory and have user enter required informationLines 21-30	Read in temperature response parameters and habitat temperature parameters and create data frame for results and for populations that go extinct in the population modelLines 33-59	Get parameters for selected population, read in DDE model time-series data, and determine if the population has gone extinct and remove any data after the extinctionLines 61-71	Define habitat temperature function (Eq. 5) and start and end times for integrating model population dynamicsLines 74-95	Integrate model population dynamics in the recent climate by quantifying mean adult density and active period and then the coefficient of variation of adult density from model time-series data (mean adult density and coefficient of variation of adult density are set to zero for populations that have gone extinct)Lines 98-119	Integrate model population dynamics in the future climate by quantifying mean adult density and active period and then the coefficient of variation of adult density from model time-series data (mean adult density and coefficient of variation of adult density are set to zero for populations that have gone extinct)Lines 122-143	Record results, end for loop, and output results in CSV file (if save = TRUE)
