ReadMe for ÒFitness metrics and components.RÓThe following ReadMe gives a brief overview of how to use ÒFitness metrics and components.RÓ to produce the temperature response panels in Figure 1 of the manuscript.Input: User-defined response for a fitness metric or fitness componentOutput: Plots of temperature responses as in Figure 1 of the manuscript.To run: 1. Select the fitness metric or fitness component by removing the Ò#Ó in front of the desired response (making sure that there is a "#" in front of all other responses)2. Run the scriptPotential issues:* The script only works if the working directory (see line 9) is in the main folder of the downloaded GitHub repoScript details:Lines 5-18	Load required packages, set working directory and have user enter required informationLines 20-28	Read in habitat temperature parameters and model predictions for rm and R0 and select data for Clavigralla shadabi in Benin (change Ò1,Ó for different insect populations)Lines 30-44	Quantify daily mean temperatures (for histograms in Fig. 1A,B)Lines 46-64	Set plot options and define temperature responses (note: increased mortality at low temperatures is incorporated for illustrative purposes; see Fig. 1D) Lines 66-75	Plot TPC curvesLines 77-97	Quantify mean values of rm and R0 (orange and blue points in Fig. 1A,B)Lines 99-106	Plot temperature histograms for the recent and future climates (see Fig. 1A,B)
