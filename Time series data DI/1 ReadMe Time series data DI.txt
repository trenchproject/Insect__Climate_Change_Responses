ReadMe Time series data DIThe following ReadMe gives a brief overview of the columns of the files produced by the population model (“DDE population dynamics.py”) in the “Time Series data DI” folder (where “DI” stands for “density independent”). Files that start with “Future time series” were run in the future time period; and files that start with “Recent time series” were run in the recent time period.* Time: Day in the model (time t)* J: Juvenile density at time t* A: Adult density at time t* S: Juvenile survival at time t* tau: Development time at time t
