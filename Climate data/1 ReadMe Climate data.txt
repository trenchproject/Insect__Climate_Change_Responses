ReadMe Biological dataThe following ReadMe gives a brief overview of the columns in “Climate station data.xlxs” and the future and recent climate data CSV files.“Climate station data.xlxs”: Data about the climate stations used to obtain historical climate data.* Population: Species name and geographical location (to distinguish between populations with the same species name)* Location: Geographic location, typically the country name followed by a name of the regionin which the population was collected* Latitude: Latitude of the insect population* Station_Name: Name of the climate station* Station_Lat: Latitude of the climate station* Station_Lon: Longitude of the climate station* Station_Elev: Elevation of the climate station* Station_Code: Code for the climate station* Station_WMO: World Meteorological Organization code for the climate station* Start_yr: Year in which the climate data sequence starts* Start_mo: Month in which the climate data sequence starts* Start_day: Day in which the climate data sequence starts* End_yr: Year in which the climate data sequence ends* End_mo: Month in which the climate data sequence ends* End_day: Day in which the climate data sequence ends* Year_of_data: Number of years of climate dataFuture climate data CVS files: Future climate data assembled in “Read climate data.R” and used in “Habitat temperatures.R” to estimate the habitat temperature parameters (Eq. 5).* day: Numerical day of the year (e.g., January 10 = day 10)* time: Calendar date (DD.MM.YYYY)* latitude: Latitude from which future climate data was downloaded* longitude: Longitude from which future climate data was downloaded* T: Mean daily temperature in KelvinRecent climate data CVS files: Recent climate data assembled in “Read climate data.R” and used in “Habitat temperatures.R” to estimate the habitat temperature parameters (Eq. 5).* day: Numerical day of the year (e.g., January 10 = day 10)* T: Mean daily temperature in Kelvin
